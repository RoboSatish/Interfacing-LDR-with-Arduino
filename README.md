# Interfacing-LDR-with-Arduino

LDR SENSOR is nothing but a light-dependent resistor, its resistance changes according to changes in light intensity.  In this blog we will discuss what LDR SENSOR is and how it can be used with the Arduino Development Board.
Those stud lights have LDR SENSOR, battery, controller unit and solar panel inbuilt. In the daytime, when there will be sufficient sunlight, the controller unit receives input from the LDR sensor and according to the received input the control unit either charges the battery or turns on the light. ![ldr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6374773/208241500-a7c0ca05-a197-40b0-94d9-52d3c325396e.png)
